It occurs when high blood sugar damages blood vessels in the retina (back of the eye). Diabetic retinopathy is typically diagnosed by ophthalmologists via fundus photography. They take a picture of your retina and look for the telltale signs as shown below:\n\n![](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Asiri_Wijesinghe/publication/303481072/figure/fig1/AS:394097530556416@1470971581841/Retinal-lesions-in-DR-such-as-microaneurysms-exudates-and-hemorrhages-regions-13.png)\n\nMicroaneyrsm - a tiny swelling in the side of a blood vessel characterized by small red dots on the retina\n\nHemmorages - bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel\n\nSoft exudates (cotton-wool spots) - internal superficial leakage from retinal arteries\n\nHard exudates - extracellular lipid leaked from retinal capillaries characterized by yellow grains\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From a Kaggle competition, I was able to access ~3,600 retina images. \n\nEach image in the training dataset was labeled with one of the following diagnoses: \n\n0 - No DR\n\n1 - Mild\n\n2 - Moderate\n\n3 - Severe\n\n4 - Proliferative DR\n\nMy goal for this project was to diagnosis whether a patient has diabetic retinopathy (DR) (and to what degree) from running these fundus photos through my machine learning algorithm.\n\nFirst, I imported the data from the Kaggle competition by reading in the training csv."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n#from keras.preprocessing import image\nimport cv2\nfrom tqdm import tqdm \nfrom PIL import Image, ImageEnhance","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"N=3662 # number of images \n\ndf_train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/train.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at a portion of the training data csv:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As shown above, the csv gives the image's id_code in the first column and the corresponding diagnosis for severity of diabetic retinopathy in the second column."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's take a look at the distribution of diabetic retinopathy diagnosis by plotting a histogram of the counts and printing the raw counts:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"(counts,bin_edges,_)=plt.hist(df_train['diagnosis'],align='left',bins=5,edgecolor='purple',linewidth=1.5,color='lavender')\nplt.title('Histogram of diabetic retinopathy diagnosis', fontsize=14,weight='bold')\nplt.xticks(bin_edges[:-1], np.arange(0,5,1))\n\nax=plt.gca()\nax.set_xlabel('Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis',fontsize=12);\nax.set_ylabel('Frequency',fontsize=12);\n\ndf_train['diagnosis'].value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the actual retina images we got from the Kaggle competition:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"paths='../input/aptos2019-blindness-detection/train_images/'+df_train['id_code'][:5]+'.png'\nplt.figure(figsize=(20,4))\nfor index, (path,label) in enumerate(zip(paths,df_train['diagnosis'][:5])):\n    plt.subplot(1,5,index+1)\n    plt.imshow(Image.open(path))\n    plt.title('Diagnosis: %i\\n' % label, fontsize = 20)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> **Image Preprocssing **\n\nBefore running the images through my machine learning algorithm, I wanted to standardize all the images and improve lighting conditions to make the telltale signs of diabetic retinopathy that we discussed earlier more obvious. \n\nSince these images come from a variety of clinics and imaging conditions, the sizes of the image are different and so I created a function called preprocess_image to resize the images to 224x224 and increase the image contrast by 1.5x.
